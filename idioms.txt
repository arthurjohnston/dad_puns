a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a blessing in disguise
a chip on your shoulder
a dime a dozen
a drop in the bucket
a fly on the wall
a penny for your thoughts
a piece of cake
a slap on the wrist
a taste of your own medicine
actions speak louder than words
add fuel to the fire
add insult to injury
all ears
all in the same boat
an arm and a leg
apple of my eye
back to square one
back to the drawing board
ball is in your court
barking up the wrong tree
beat a dead horse
beat around the bush
beggars can't be choosers
best of both worlds
better late than never
between a rock and a hard place
birds of a feather flock together
bite off more than you can chew
bite the bullet
bite the dust
blood is thicker than water
blow off steam
break a leg
break the ice
burn bridges
burn the midnight oil
burst your bubble
bury the hatchet
by the skin of your teeth
call it a day
calm before the storm
can't judge a book by its cover
caught red handed
chasing your tail
close but no cigar
cost an arm and a leg
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilt milk
cry wolf
curiosity killed the cat
cut corners
cut the mustard
cut to the chase
devil's advocate
don't count your chickens before they hatch
don't put all your eggs in one basket
drastic times call for drastic measures
easy as pie
eleventh hour
every cloud has a silver lining
face the music
fall on deaf ears
feeling under the weather
few and far between
fight fire with fire
finding a needle in a haystack
fit as a fiddle
get a taste of your own medicine
get out of hand
get something off your chest
get the ball rolling
get your act together
give someone the cold shoulder
go back to the drawing board
go down in flames
go on a wild goose chase
good things come to those who wait
grasp at straws
hang in there
head over heels
hear something straight from the horse's mouth
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack
hold your horses
ignorance is bliss
in the heat of the moment
in the red
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
jump the gun
keep an eye on
keep your chin up
keep your fingers crossed
kill two birds with one stone
know which way the wind blows
last straw
leave no stone unturned
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
light at the end of the tunnel
like riding a bike
live and learn
look before you leap
loose cannon
lose your marbles
make a long story short
miss the boat
money doesn't grow on trees
no pain no gain
not playing with a full deck
off the hook
on cloud nine
on the ball
on the fence
on the same page
on thin ice
once bitten twice shy
once in a blue moon
out of sight out of mind
out of the frying pan and into the fire
over the moon
piece of cake
play devil's advocate
play it by ear
pulling your leg
put all your eggs in one basket
put something on ice
rain on someone's parade
raining cats and dogs
read between the lines
right as rain
roll with the punches
rule of thumb
run like the wind
see eye to eye
sit tight
skating on thin ice
sleep on it
slip of the tongue
speak of the devil
spill the beans
steal someone's thunder
step up to the plate
stick to your guns
straight from the horse's mouth
strike while the iron is hot
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
take the bull by the horns
taste of your own medicine
the ball is in your court
the best thing since sliced bread
the last straw
the whole nine yards
there's no place like home
throw in the towel
throw someone under the bus
time flies
tip of the iceberg
to go cold turkey
to make matters worse
turn a blind eye
under the weather
up a creek without a paddle
water under the bridge
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
wear your heart on your sleeve
when it rains it pours
when pigs fly
whole nine yards
wouldn't be caught dead
you can say that again
you can't have your cake and eat it too
your guess is as good as mine
