a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a blessing in disguise
a chip on your shoulder
a dime a dozen
a drop in the bucket
a fly on the wall
a penny for your thoughts
a piece of cake
a slap on the wrist
a taste of your own medicine
actions speak louder than words
add fuel to the fire
add insult to injury
all ears
all in the same boat
an arm and a leg
apple of my eye
back to square one
back to the drawing board
ball is in your court
barking up the wrong tree
beat a dead horse
beat around the bush
beggars can't be choosers
best of both worlds
better late than never
between a rock and a hard place
birds of a feather flock together
bite off more than you can chew
bite the bullet
bite the dust
blood is thicker than water
blow off steam
break a leg
break the ice
burn bridges
burn the midnight oil
burst your bubble
bury the hatchet
by the skin of your teeth
call it a day
calm before the storm
can't judge a book by its cover
caught red handed
chasing your tail
close but no cigar
cost an arm and a leg
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilt milk
cry wolf
curiosity killed the cat
cut corners
cut the mustard
cut to the chase
devil's advocate
don't count your chickens before they hatch
don't put all your eggs in one basket
drastic times call for drastic measures
easy as pie
eleventh hour
every cloud has a silver lining
face the music
fall on deaf ears
feeling under the weather
few and far between
fight fire with fire
finding a needle in a haystack
fit as a fiddle
get a taste of your own medicine
get out of hand
get something off your chest
get the ball rolling
get your act together
give someone the cold shoulder
go back to the drawing board
go down in flames
go on a wild goose chase
good things come to those who wait
grasp at straws
hang in there
head over heels
hear something straight from the horse's mouth
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack
hold your horses
ignorance is bliss
in the heat of the moment
in the red
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
jump the gun
keep an eye on
keep your chin up
keep your fingers crossed
kill two birds with one stone
know which way the wind blows
last straw
leave no stone unturned
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
light at the end of the tunnel
like riding a bike
live and learn
look before you leap
loose cannon
lose your marbles
make a long story short
miss the boat
money doesn't grow on trees
no pain no gain
not playing with a full deck
off the hook
on cloud nine
on the ball
on the fence
on the same page
on thin ice
once bitten twice shy
once in a blue moon
out of sight out of mind
out of the frying pan and into the fire
over the moon
piece of cake
play devil's advocate
play it by ear
pulling your leg
put all your eggs in one basket
put something on ice
rain on someone's parade
raining cats and dogs
read between the lines
right as rain
roll with the punches
rule of thumb
run like the wind
see eye to eye
sit tight
skating on thin ice
sleep on it
slip of the tongue
speak of the devil
spill the beans
steal someone's thunder
step up to the plate
stick to your guns
straight from the horse's mouth
strike while the iron is hot
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
take the bull by the horns
taste of your own medicine
the ball is in your court
the best thing since sliced bread
the last straw
the whole nine yards
there's no place like home
throw in the towel
throw someone under the bus
time flies
tip of the iceberg
to go cold turkey
to make matters worse
turn a blind eye
under the weather
up a creek without a paddle
water under the bridge
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
wear your heart on your sleeve
when it rains it pours
when pigs fly
whole nine yards
wouldn't be caught dead
you can say that again
you can't have your cake and eat it too
your guess is as good as mine
All roads lead to Rome
All singing, all dancing
Apples and oranges
As the crow flies
Back-seat driver
Barking up the wrong tree
Bed of roses
Belling the Cat
Best friends forever
Between Scylla and Charybdis
Birds of a feather flock together
Black sheep
Blessing in disguise
Blood, toil, tears and sweat
The Boy Who Cried Wolf
Bread and butter
Break a leg
pass the buck
Cabin fever
Call a spade a spade
The captain goes down with the ship
Carrot and stick
Cart before the horse
Cat and mouse
Chink in one's armor
Chip on shoulder
Circle the wagons
Cloak and dagger
Cock and bull story
Cold shoulder
The Country Mouse and the City Mouse
Crime of the century
Crocodile tears
Cutting off one's nose to spite one's face
Damning with faint praise
Dark horse
Dead ringer
Death and taxes
The devil is in the details
Devil's advocate
Die with your boots on
The Dog in the Manger
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Down the rabbit hole
Down Under
if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck
Eating crow
Eating your own dog food
Elbow grease
Elephant in the room
Exception that proves the rule
Eye for an eye
Fatted calf
A feather in your cap
Flogging a dead horse
Forbidden fruit
Freudian slip
Fruit of the poisonous tree
Get a life
Get away with murder
Getting the wind knocked out of you
Gone to the Dogs
A grain of salt
Hair's breadth
Ham it up
Hoist with his own petard
Hold your horses
Humble pie
glass half empty or half full
It takes two to tango
Jack of all trades
Jumping the shark
Kick the bucket
The lady doth protest too much
Lion's share
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Man bites dog
Man's best friend
Marketplace of ideas
Medicine chest (idiom)
Melting pot
Mexican standoff
Mind your Ps and Qs
Misnomer
Monkey's uncle
My two cents
Oldest profession
Out of the frying pan into the fire
Pork barrel
The pot calling the kettle black
Powder keg
The quick and the dead
Rags to riches
The real McCoy
Red herring
Red-light district
Reinventing the wheel
Rest in peace
Riding shotgun
School of Hard Knocks
Silver bullet
Silver lining
Silver spoon
Sitting on the fence
Skeleton in the closet
Skin of my teeth
Sliced bread
Smoke and mirrors
Speak of the devil
Spitting distance
Square peg in a round hole
Stalking horse
Stiff upper lip
A stone's throw away
Straw that broke the camel's back
Taking the piss
Tall, dark and handsome
Teaching grandmother to suck eggs
Tell it to the Marines
Tempest in a teapot
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Throw to the wolves
Tip of the tongue
To rob Peter to pay Paul
Toe the line
Tongue-in-cheek
Too cheap to meter
The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse
Trial of the century
Trip the light fantastic
Turn in one's grave
Twiddly bits
Underwater basket weaving
Up to eleven
Watches of the night
Watching paint dry
What's done is done
When pigs fly
White elephant
The whole nine yards
With flying colours
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Woman card
Work husband
work wife
Writing about music is like dancing about architecture
You can't have your cake and eat it
